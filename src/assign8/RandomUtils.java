     *   Create a Static Class Method called getRandomRange that accepts two
     *   doubles as its parameters: one for starting number, and one for ending
     *   number for a range to pick randomly. The goal of this method is to produce
     *   random numbers between two bounds.
     *   - Example: getRandomRange(10,13) -> could produce any of 10, 11, 12 
     *          or 13, but also any random floating point numbers between the two 
     *          (eg- 10.5, 11.123, 12.987, etc...)
