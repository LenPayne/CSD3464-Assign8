public class Fish {
    /*
     * This class models a fish to be caught. Each fish has the following properties:
     * - Weight (in grams)
     * - Length (in centimetres)
     * - Species (in words)
     * So, for example, a Fish can be a 15cm, 200g Perch.
     * Provide simple getters and setters. Also provide the following constructors:
     * - Fish() - Set a random length from 10-30cm and a random weight from 150-300g and set the fish species to "Carp"
     * - Fish(species) - Set a random length from 10-30cm and a random weight from 150-300g using RandomUtils
     * - Fish(species, weight, length) - Set the specific values for properties
